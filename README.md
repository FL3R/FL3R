Hi, I'm Armando, but everyone call me FL3R!
Developer, nurse and gamer.
I read anything interesting there is on the face of Earth and Wikipedia and Google help me to find out. Engaged to a wonderful girl, glad I do not have an infinite number of "friends" online, but few (and real) in real life, scout for over fifteen years, dreamer for a lifetime.
